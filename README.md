DTU course with the homeworks and the code written in Pyhton for the DTU Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence course: Cognitive Modeling.

Theories of cognition, seen from an information-processing perspective, have been implemented into quantitative models throughout these projects. More specifically, models of attention, memory and perception are discussed, including their commonalities and variations. These are based maily on statistical mathematical backgrounds.

• Psychophysics

• Bayesian Models of visual perception

• Signal detection theory

• PCA/ICA for edge detection and dimensionality reduction

• Psychometric function
